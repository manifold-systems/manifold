# Extension Classes via `@Extension`

Similar to other languages such as [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/csharp),
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), and [Gosu](https://gosu-lang.github.io/), with Manifold you can define methods and
other features as logical extensions to existing Java classes. This is achieved using _extension classes_. An extension
class is a normal Java class you define as a container for features you want to apply to another class, normally to one
you can't modify directly, such as `java.lang.String`:

```java
package extensions.java.lang.String;

import manifold.ext.api.*;

@Extension
public class MyStringExtension {

  public static void print(@This String thiz) {
    System.out.println(thiz);
  }

  @Extension
  public static String lineSeparator() {
    return System.lineSeparator();
  }
}
```

All extension classes must be sub-rooted in the `extensions` package where the remainder of the package
must be the qualified name of the extended class. As the example illustrates, an extension
class on `java.lang.String` must reside directly in a package equal to or ending with `extensions.java.lang.String`. Note this
convention facilitates the extension discovery process and avoids the overhead and ceremony of
alternative means such as annotation processors.

In **Java 9** because a package must reside in a single module, you should prepend your module name to the extension package
name to avoid illegal sharing of packages between modules.  For example, if your module were named `foo.widget` you
should define your extension class as `foo.widget.extensions.java.lang.String`.  In Java 8 all extension classes can be 
directly rooted in the `extensions` package, however it is still best to qualify extension classes with your project
or module name to prevent naming collisions.

Additionally, an extension class must be annotated with `manifold.ext.api.Extension`, which distinguishes
extension classes from other classes that may reside in the same package.

## Extension Method Basics

An extension method must be declared `static` and non-`private`. As the receiver of the call, the first
parameter of an extension _instance_ method must have the same type as the extended class. The
`MyStringExtension` example illustrates this; the first parameter of instance method `print` is
`java.lang.String`. Note the parameter name _thiz_ is conventional, you can use any name you like.
Finally, the receiver parameter must be annotated with `manifold.ext.api.This` to distinguish it from 
regular methods in the class.

That's all there is to it. You can use extensions just like normal methods on the extended class:

```java
String name = "Manifold";
name.print();
```

You can define `static` extension methods too. Since static methods don't have a receiver, the method
itself must be annotated with `manifold.ext.api.Extension`:

```java
@Extension
public static String lineSeparator() {
  return System.lineSeparator();
}
```

Call static extensions just as if they were on the extended class:

```java
String.lineSeparator()
```

## Generics

You can extend generic classes too and define generic methods. This is how Manifold extension libraries
work with collections and other generic classes. For example, here is the `first()` extension method on
`Iterable`:

```java
public static <T> T first(@This Iterable<T> thiz, Predicate<T> predicate) {
  for (T element: thiz) {
    if (predicate.test(element)) {
      return element;
    }
  }
  throw new NoSuchElementException();
}
```

Notice the extension is a generic method with the same type variable designation as the
extended class: `T` from `Iterable<T>`. Since extension methods are static this is how we convey type
variables from the extended class to the extension method. Note type variable names must match the 
extended type's type variables and must be declared in the same order.

To define a generic extension method you append the type variables of the method to the list of the
extended class' type variables. Manifold's `map()` extension illustrates this format:

```java
public static <E, R> Stream<R> map(@This Collection<E> thiz, Function<? super E, R> mapper) {
  return thiz.stream().map(mapper);
}
```

Here `map` is a generic extension method having type variable `R` and conveying `Collection`'s type
variable `E`.

## Static Dispatching

An extension class does not physically alter its extended class; the methods defined in an extension are
not really inserted into the extended class. Instead the Java compiler and Manifold cooperate to make a
call to a static method in an extension look like a call to an instance method on the extended class. As a
consequence extension calls dispatch **statically**.

So unlike a virtual method call an extension call is always made based on the extended type declared in
the extension, not the runtime type of the left hand side of the call. To illustrate:

```java
public class Tree {
}

public class Dogwood extends Tree {
}

public static void bark(@This Tree thiz) {
  println("rough");
}
public static void bark(@This Dogwood thiz) {
  println("ruff");
}

Tree tree = new Dogwood();
tree.bark(); // "rough"
```

At compile-time `tree` is of type `Tree`, therefore it transforms to a static invocation of `bark(Tree)`,
which prints "rough".

Another consequence of static dispatching is that an extension method can receive a call even if the value
of the extended object is `null` at the call site. Manifold extension libraries exploit this feature to
improve readability and null-safety. For example, `CharSequence.isNullOrEmpty()` compares the
receiver's value to null so you don't have to:

```java
public static boolean isNullOrEmpty(@This CharSequence thiz) {
  return thiz == null || thiz.length() == 0;
}

String name = null;
if (name.isNullOrEmpty()) {
  println("empty");
}
```

Here the example doesn't check for null and instead shifts the burden to the extension.

## Accessibility and Scope

An extension method never shadows or overrides a class method; when an extension method's name and
parameters match a class method, the class method always has precedence over the extension. For example:

```java
public class Tree {
  public void kind() {
    println("evergreen");
  }
}

public static void kind(@This Tree thiz) {
  println("binary");
}
```

The extension method never wins, a call to `kind()` always prints "evergreen". Additionally, if at
compile-time `Tree` and the extension conflict as in the example, the compiler warns of the conflict
in the extension class.

An extension method can still _overload_ a class method where the method names are the same, but the 
parameter types are different:

```java
public class Tree {
  public void harvest() {
    println("nuts");
  }
}

public static void harvest(@This Tree thiz, boolean all) {
  println(all ? "wood" : thiz.harvest());
}
```

A call to `tree.harvest(true)` prints "wood".

Since extension method references resolve at compile-time, you can limit the compile-time accessibility
of an extension class simply by limiting the scope of the JAR file containing the extension. For example,
if you're using Maven the scope of an extension matches the dependency relationship you assign in your
pom.xml file. Similarly in module-aware IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA, an extension's scope is the same as
the module's.

## Annotation Extensions

In addition to adding new methods, extension classes can also add _annotations_ to a class. At present
annotation extensions are limited to the extended _class_; you can't yet add annotations to members of 
the class.

Beware, extensions are limited to a compile-time existence. Therefore, even if an 
annotation has `RUNTIME` retention, it will only be present on the extended class at compile-time. This 
feature is most useful when using annotation processors and you need to annotate classes you otherwise 
can't modify.

Also it's worth pointing out you can make existing interfaces _structural_ using annotation extensions:

```java
package extensions.abc.Widget;
@Extension
@Structural // makes the interface structural
public class MyWidgetExtension {
}
```

This extension effectively changes the `abc.Widget` _nominal_ interface to a _structural_ interface. In the context
of your project classes no longer have to declare they implement it nominally.  

See [Structural Interfaces](#structural-interfaces-via-structural) later in this guide for fuller coverage of the topic.

## Extension Interfaces

An extension class can add structural interfaces to its extended class.  This feature helps with a 
variety of use-cases.  For example, let's say we have a class `Foo` and interface `Hello`:
  
```java
public final class Foo {
  public String sayHello() {
    return "hello";      
  }
}

@Structural
public interface Hello {
  String sayHello();
}
```

Although `Foo` does not implement `Hello` nominally, it defines the `sayHello()` method that otherwise 
satisfies the interface.  Let's assume we don't control `Foo`'s implementation, but we need it to
implement `Hello` nominally.  We can do that with an extension interface:

```java
@Extension
public class MyFooExtension implements Hello {
}
```

Now the compiler believes `Foo` directly implements `Hello`: 

```java
Hello hello = new Foo();
hello.sayHello();
```
Note `Hello` is structural, so even without the extension interface, instances of `Foo` are still 
compatible with `Hello`. It's less convenient, though, because you have to explicitly cast `Foo` to `Hello` --
a purely structural relationship in Manifold requires a cast. Basically extension interfaces save you
from casting. This not only
improves readability, it also prevents confusion in cases involving type inference where it may not be 
obvious that casting is necessary.

It's worth pointing out you can both add an interface _and_ implement its methods
by extension:
```java
public final class Shy {
}

@Extension
public abstract class MyShyExtension implements Hello {
  public static String sayHello(@This Shy thiz) {
    return "hi";    
  }
}
```
This example extends `Shy` to nominally implement `Hello` _and_ provides the `Hello` implementation. Note
the abstract modifier on the extension class.  This is necessary because it doesn't really implement the
interface, the extended class does.

You can also use extension interfaces to extract interfaces from classes you don't
control.  For example, if you want to provide an immutable view of a collection class
such as `java.util.List`, you could use extension interfaces to extract immutable and
mutable interfaces from the class.  As such your code is better suited to confine
`List` operations on otherwise fully mutable lists.


## Extension Libraries

An extension library is a logical grouping of functionality defined by a set of extension classes.
Manifold includes several extension libraries for commonly used classes, many of which are adapted
from Kotlin extensions.  Each library is available as a separate module or Jar file you can add 
to your project separately depending on its needs.

*   **Collections**

    Defined in module `manifold-collections` this library extends:
    - java.lang.Iterable
    - java.util.Collection
    - java.util.List
    - java.util.stream.Stream

*   **Text**

    Defined in module `manifold-text` this library extends:
    - java.lang.CharSequence
    - java.lang.String

*   **I/O**

    Defined in module `manifold-io` this library extends:
    - java.io.BufferedReader
    - java.io.File
    - java.io.InputStream
    - java.io.OutputStream
    - java.io.Reader
    - java.io.Writer

*   **Web/JSON/YAML**
 
    Defined in module `manifold-json` this library extends:
    - java.net.URL
    - javax.script.Bindings

> **&#x1f6c8;** **IMPORTANT!**  
> You can create your own custom extension libraries.  There's nothing special about a "library", it's just a normal

>  <plugins>
>    <plugin>
>      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
>      <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
>      <configuration>
>        <archive>
>          <manifestEntries>
>            <!--class files as source must be available for extension method classes-->
>            <Contains-Sources>java,class</Contains-Sources>
>          </manifestEntries>
>        </archive>
>      </configuration>
>    </plugin>
>  </plugins>
></build>
>```
> Similarly with **Gradle** add the `Contains-Sources` manifest attribute:
>```groovy
>jar {
>  manifest {
>    attributes('Contains-Sources':'java,class')
>  }
>}
>```

## Generating Extension Classes

Sometimes the contents of an extension class reflect metadata from other resources.  In this case rather 
than painstakingly writing such classes by hand it's easier and less error prone to produce them via 
type manifold.  To facilitate this use-case, your type manifold must implement the `IExtensionClassProducer`
interface so that the `ExtensionManifold` can discover information about the classes your type
manifold produces. For the typical use case your type manifold should extend `AbstractExtensionProducer`.

See the `manifold-ext-producer-sample` module for a sample type manifold implementing `IExtensionClassProvider`.

>Note the [`manifold-science`](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/tree/master/manifold-deps-parent/manifold-science)
and [`manifold-collections`](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/tree/master/manifold-deps-parent/manifold-collections)
projects use operator overloading and unit expressions extensively.

# Operator Overloading

>Warning: **Experimental Feature**

The Manifold extension framework plugs into Java to provide seamless operator overloading capability. You can
type-safely provide arithmetic, relational, and [unit](#unit-expressions) operators for any class by implementing one or
more predefined operator methods. You can implement operator methods directly in your class or use [extension methods](#extension-classes-via-extension)
to implement operators for classes you don't otherwise control. For example, using extension methods Manifold provides
operator implementations for `BigDecimal` so you can write code like this:
```java
BigDecimal result = bigValue1 + bigValue2;
```


## Arithmetic and Negation Operators

Any type can support arithmetic operators by implementing one or more of the following operator methods: 

**Arithmetic**

| Operation | Method       |
|:----------|:-------------|
| `a + b`   | `a.plus(b)`  |
| `a - b`   | `a.minus(b)` |
| `a * b`   | `a.times(b)` |
| `a / b`   | `a.div(b)`   |
| `a % b`   | `a.rem(b)`   |

**Negation**

| Operation | Method           |
|:----------|:-----------------|
| `-a`      | `a.unaryMinus()` |

Note operator methods do not belong to a class or interface you implement. Instead you implement them *structurally*
simply by defining a method with the same signature. Note you can implement several different versions of the same
method differing by parameter type. 

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to implement the `+` operator:
```java
public class Point {
  public final int x, y;
  public Point(int x, int y) {this.x = x; this.y = y;}
  
  public Point plus(Point that) {
    return new Point(x + that.x, y + that.y);
  }
}

var a = new Point(1, 2);
var b = new Point(3, 4);

var sum = a + b; // Point(4, 6)
```

Since operator methods are structural, you can define *multiple* `plus()` methods:
```java
public Point plus(int[] coord) {
  if(coord.length != 2) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException();
  }
  return new Point(x + coord[0], y + coord[1]);
}
```
   
## Relational Operators

You can implement relational operators using a combination of the `ComparableUsing` and/or `Comparable` interfaces.

### `manifold.ext.api.ComparableUsing`

Relational operators can be implemented all together with the `ComparableUsing` interface, which extends `Comparable`
to provide an operator-specific API.                           
```java
boolean compareToUsing( T that, Operator op );
```
Where `Operator` is an `enum` which specifies constants for relational operators.

| Operation | ComparableUsing Impl      | Comparable Impl       |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| `a > b`   | `a.compareToUsing(b, GT)` | `a.compareTo(b) > 0`  |
| `a >= b`  | `a.compareToUsing(b, GE)` | `a.compareTo(b) >= 0` |
| `a < b`   | `a.compareToUsing(b, LT)` | `a.compareTo(b) < 0`  |
| `a <= b`  | `a.compareToUsing(b, LE)` | `a.compareTo(b) <= 0` |

`ComparableUsing` provides a default implementation for `compareToUsing()` that delegates to `Comparable`'s
`compareTo()` implementation for the `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` subset of relational operators.  For the `==` and `!=` subset
`ComparableUsing` delegates to the type's `equals()` method (more on equality later).  This behavior is suitable for
most types, so normally you only need to add `ComparableUsing` to your type's `implements` or `extends` clause and
implement just `Comparable` as you normally would. Thus adding relational operator support to the `Point` example we
have:

```java
public class Point implements ComparableUsing<Point> {
  public final int x, y;
  public Point(int x, int y) {this.x = x; this.y = y;}
  
  public Point plus(Point that) {
    return new Point(x + that.x, y + that.y);
  }
  
  public int compareTo(Point that) {
    return x - that.x;
  }
}
```
Now you can easily compare `Point` values like this:
```java
if (pt1 >= pt2) ...
```

### `java.lang.Comparable`

If you're not interested in supporting `==` and `!=` and your type implements the `Comparable` interface, it
automatically supports the `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` subset of relational operators. For example, both `java.lang.String` and
`java.time.LocalDate` implement the `compareTo()` method from `Comparable`, which means they can be used in relational
expressions:

```java
String name1;
String name2;
...
if (name1 > name2) {...}
```   

```java
LocalDate date1;
LocalDate date2;
...
if (date1 > date2) {...}
```

## Equality Operators

To implement the `==` and `!=` subset of relational operators you must implement the `ComparableUsing` interface. By
default `ComparableUsing` delegates to your type's `equals()` method, but you can easily override this behavior by
overriding the `equalityMode()` method in your `ComparableUsing` implementation. The `EqualityMode` enum provides the
available modes:     

```java
/**
 * The mode indicating the method used to implement {@code ==} and {@code !=} operators.
 */
enum EqualityMode
{
  /** Use the {@code #compareTo()} method to implement `==` and `!=` */
  CompareTo,

  /** Use the {@code equals()} method to implement `==` and `!=` (default) */
  Equals,

  /** Use {@code identity} comparison for `==` and `!=`, note this is the same as Java's normal {@code ==} behavior } */
  Identity
}
```

Based on the `EqualityMode` returned by your implementation of `CompareToUsing#equalityMode()`, the `==` and `!=`
operators compile using the following methods: 

| Operation | `Equals` <small>(default)</small> | `CompareTo`| `Identity` |
|:----------|:-------------------|:--------------------------|:-----------|
| `a == b`  | `a.equals(b)`      | `a.compareToUsing(b, EQ)` | `a == b`   |
| `a != b`  | `!a.equals(b)`     | `a.compareToUsing(b, NE)` | `a != b`   |

Note Manifold generates efficient, **null-safe** code for `==` and `!=`. For example, `a == b` using `Equals` mode
compiles as:
```java
a == b || a != null && b != null && a.equals(b)
``` 

If you need something more customized you can override `compareToUsing()` with your own logic for any of the operators,
including `==` and `!=`.
 
To enable `==` on `Point` more effectively, you can accept the default behavior of `ComparableUsing` and implement
`equals()`:
 
```java
public boolean equals(Object that) {
  return this == that || that != null && getClass() == that.getClass() && 
         x == ((Point)that).x && y == ((Point)that).y;
}
```
>Note always consider implementing `hashCode()` if you implement `equals()`, otherwise your type may not function
>properly when used with `Map` and other data structures:
>```java
>public int hashCode() {
>  return Objects.hash(x, y); 
>}
>```

Sometimes it's better to use the `CompareTo` mode.  For instance, the `==` and `!=` implementations for `Rational`,
`BigDecimal`, and `BigInteger` use the `CompareTo` mode because in those classes `compareTo()` reflects equality in
terms of the *face value* of the number they model e.g., 1.0 == 1.00, which is desirable behavior in many use-cases. As
such override `equalityMode()` to return `CompareTo`:
```java
@Override
public EqualityMode equalityMode() {
  return CompareTo;
}
```
 
## Unit Operators

Unit or "binding" operations are unique to the Manifold framework. They provide a powerfully concise syntax and can be
applied to a wide range of applications. You implement the operator with the `prefixBind()` and `postfixBind()` methods:

| Operation  | Postfix Bind       | Prefix Bind       |
|------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| `a b`      | `b.postfixBind(a)` | `a.prefixBind(b)` |

If the type of `a` implements `R prefixBind(B)` where `B` is assignable from the type of `b`, then `a b` compiles as the
method call `a.prefixBind(b)` having type `R`. Otherwise, if the type of `b` implements `R postfixBind(A)` where `A` is
assignable from the type of `a`, then `a b` compiles as the method call `b.postfixBind(a)` having type `R`.

Read more about [unit expressions](#unit-expressions) later in this document.
 
## Operators by Extension Methods 

Using [extension methods](#extension-classes-via-extension) you can provide operator implementations for classes you
don't otherwise control. For instance, Manifold provides operator extensions for
[`BigDecimal`](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/blob/master/manifold-deps-parent/manifold-ext/src/main/java/manifold/ext/extensions/java/math/BigDecimal/ManBigDecimalExt.java)
and [`BigInteger`](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/blob/master/manifold-deps-parent/manifold-ext/src/main/java/manifold/ext/extensions/java/math/BigInteger/ManBigIntegerExt.java).
These extensions are implemented in the [`manifold-science`](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/tree/master/manifold-deps-parent/manifold-science)
dependency.  

Here's what the `+` extension for `BigDecimal` looks like:
```java
@Extension
public abstract class ManBigDecimalExt implements ComparableUsing<BigDecimal> {
  /** Supports binary operator {@code +} */
  public static BigDecimal plus(@This BigDecimal thiz, BigDecimal that) {
    return thiz.add(that);
  }
  ...
}
```
Now you can perform arithmetic and comparisons using operator expressions:
```java
if (bd1 >= bd2) {
  BigDecimal result = bd1 + bd2;
  . . .
}
```

>Note the [`manifold-science`](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/tree/master/manifold-deps-parent/manifold-science)
and [`manifold-collections`](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/tree/master/manifold-deps-parent/manifold-collections)
projects use operator overloading and unit expressions extensively.
   

# Unit Expressions
>Warning: **Experimental Feature**

Extending [operator overloading](#operator-overloading) further, Manifold seamlessly plugs into Java to provide Unit
(or *Binding*) Expressions.  This feature is unique to the Manifold framework and provides a powerfully concise syntax
that can be applied to a wide range of applications.

Units are just normal identifiers, you can define them anywhere with fields and local variables and use them directly.
Normally you import predefined unit constants like the ones provided in `UnitConstants` from the
`manifold.science.util` package:
```java
import static manifold.science.util.UnitConstants.kg;
import static manifold.science.util.UnitConstants.hr;
import static manifold.science.util.UnitConstants.mph;
. . .
```
Using imported constants such as `kg` for `Kilogram`, `hr` for `Hour`, `mph` for `Mile/Hour`, etc. you can
begin working with unit expressions:

**Simple and easy to read syntax**
```java
Length distance = 100 mph * 3 hr;
```
**Type-safe**
```java
Force force = 5kg * 9.807 m/s/s; // 49.035 Newtons
```
**Logically equivalent units are equal**
```java
var force = 49.035 kg m/s/s;
force == 49.035 N // true
```
**Maintain integrity with different units**
```java
Mass m = 10 lb + 10 kg; 
```
**Easily make Ranges with the `to` constant from [`RangeFun`](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/blob/master/manifold-deps-parent/manifold-collections/src/main/java/manifold/collections/api/range/RangeFun.java)**
```java
for( Mass m: 10kg to 100kg ) {...}
```
**Conveniently work with Money**
```java
Money payment = 1.5M USD; 
Money vat = 162k EUR;
Money total = payment + vat; // naturally works with multiple currencies
``` 
>Note unit expressions and *operator overloading* are often used together, read more about [operator overloading](#operator-overloading).

## How does it work?
Normally a *binary* expression in Java and most other languages involves two operands separated by an operator such as
`+` for addition:
```java
int sum = a + b;
```

But with a unit expression the operands are directly adjacent without an operator separating them:
```java
Mass m = 10 kg;
```

The operation is _declared_ in an operand's type with one of the following methods:
```java
public R prefixBind(T rhs);
public R postfixBind(T lhs);
``` 
Where either the left operand defines `prefixBind(T rhs)` or the right operand defines `postfixBind(T lhs)`.

In the example, `10` is a literal value of type `int` and `kg` is a variable of type `MassUnit`. Since `kg` is on the
right-hand side of `10` and the `MassUnit` class defines the method:
```java
public Mass postfixBind(Number magnitude) {...}
``` 
the compiler translates the expression as the method call `kg.postfixBind(10)` resulting in type `Mass`.

Note `postfixBind()` and `prefixBind()` do not belong to a class or interface you implement. Instead you implement
them *structurally* simply by defining a method with the same name, parameter, and non-void return type. This is
necessary because a type may implement multiple versions of the same method. This level of flexibility is otherwise not
supported with Java's name-based type system. 

## Operator Precedence

The empty or "binding" operator has a *phased* precedence. Lexically, its precedence lies between addition and
multiplication, thus during the compiler's parsing phase it produces an untyped AST reflecting this order.  However,
in the course of the compiler's type attribution phase the compiler restructures the AST to reflect binding operator
methods `prefixBind()` and `postfixBind()` declared in the operand types, during which the compiler considers the
binding operator as having a precedence *equal to* multiplication.

To illustrate consider the following expression:
```java
a b * c
```

The binding operator, having a lexical precedence less than multiplication, parses like this:
```java
a (b * c)
```

In a later stage when operand types are available the expression may restructure if:
1. `a` and `b` have a binding relationship declared with `A.postfixBind(B)` or `B.prefixBind(A)` and
2. the type of the resulting `(a b)` expression implements multiplication with the type of `c`
```java
(a b) * c
``` 

For example, the expression `5 kg * 2` reflects this example exactly.

As you can see unit expressions demand a level of flexibility beyond that of conventional compilers such as Java's. But
Java is flexible enough in its architecture so that Manifold can reasonably plug in to augment it with this capability.
    
## Type-safe and Simple

There is nothing special about a unit, it is just a simple expression, most of the time just a variable. You can easily
define your own aliases for units like the ones defined in `manifold.science.util.UnitConstants`.
```java
LengthUnit m = LengthUnit.Meter;
Length twoMeters = 2 m;
``` 

## More Than Units

What makes unit expressions work is simple, just a pair of methods you can implement on any types you like: 
```java
public R postfixBind(T lhs);
public R prefixBind(T rhs);
``` 
If your type implements either of these, it is the basis of a potential "unit" expression. Thus, the application of
these methods goes beyond just units. To illustrate, let's say you want to make date "literal" expressions such as:   
```java
LocalMonthDay d1 = May 15;
LocalYearMonth d2 = 2019 May;
LocalDate d3 = 2019 May 15;
```
Binding expressions easily accommodate this use-case.  Something like:
```java
package com.example;

public enum Month {
  January,
  February,
  March,
  April,
  May,
  ... // etc.
  
  public LocalMonthDay prefixBind(Integer date) {
    return new LocalMonthDay(this, date);
  }
  
  public LocalYearMonth postfixBind(Integer year) {
    return new LocalYearMonth(this, date);
  }
}
```
In turn `LocalYearMonth` can define `LocalDate prefixBind(Integer)`. That's all there is to it. Now you have type-safe
date expressions:
```java
import static com.example.Month.*;
...
LocalDate date = 2019 October 9;
```

Essentially you can implement binding expressions to make use of juxtaposition wherever your imagination takes you.

## Science & Ranges
Of course, as some of the examples illustrate, unit expressions are especially well suited as the basis for a library
modeling physical dimensions such as length, time, mass, etc. Indeed, check out the [`manifold-science`](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/tree/master/manifold-deps-parent/manifold-science)
dependency.

Another application of units involves the [Range API](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/tree/master/manifold-deps-parent/manifold-collections#ranges)
provided by the [`manifold-collections`](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/tree/master/manifold-deps-parent/manifold-collections)
dependency. Simply by importing the static constants from `RangeRun` you can easily work with ranges:
```java
Range range = 1 to 5;
```
```java
for (Rational csr: 5.2r to 15.7r step 0.3r) {...}
```
```java
for (Mass mass: 10kg to 100kg unit lb) {...}
```
```java
if ("le matos" inside "a" to "m~") {...}
``` 

# Structural Interfaces via `@Structural`

Java is a _nominally_ typed language -- types are assignable based on the names declared in their definitions. For
example:

```java
public class Foo {
  public void hello() {
    println("hello");
  }
}

public interface Greeting {
  void hello();
}

Greeting foo = new Foo(); // error
```

This does not compile because `Foo` does not explicitly implement `Greeting` by name in its `implements`
clause.

By contrast a _structurally_ typed language has no problem with this example.  Basically, structural typing
requires only that a class implement interface _methods_, there is no need for a class to declare that it
implements an interface.

Although nominal typing is perhaps more sound and easier for both people and machines to digest, in some
circumstances the flexibility of structural typing makes it more suitable. Take the following classes:

```java
public class Rectangle {
  public double getX();
  public double getY();
  ...
}

public class Point {
  public double getX();
  public double getY();
  ...
}

public class Component {
  public int getX();
  public int getY();
  ...
}
```

Let's say we're tasked with sorting instances of these according to location in the coordinate plane, say
as a `Comparator` implementation. Each class defines methods for obtaining X, Y coordinates, but these
classes don't implement a common interface. We don't control the implementation of the classes, so we're
faced with having to write three distinct, yet nearly identical, Comparators.

This is where the flexibility of structural interfaces could really help. If Java supported it, we'd
declare a structural interface with `getX()` and` getY()` methods and write only one `Comparator`:

```java
public interface Coordinate {
  double getX();
  double getY();
}

Comparator<Coordinate> coordSorter = new Comparator<>() {
  public int compare(Coordinate c1, Coordinate c2) {
    int res = c1.Y == c2.Y ? c1.X - c2.X : c2.Y - c1.Y;
    return res < 0 ? -1 : res > 0 ? 1 : 0;
  }
}

List<Point> points = Arrays.asList(new Point(2, 1), new Point(3, 5), new Point(1, 1));
Collections.sort(points, coordSorter); // error
```

Of course Java is not happy with this because because `Point` does not nominally implement `Coordinate`. 

This is where Manifold can help with structural interfaces:

```java
@Structural
public interface Coordinate {
  double getX();
  double getY();
}
```

Adding `@Structural` to `Coordinate` effectively changes it to behave _structurally_ -- Java no longer
requires classes to implement it by name, only its methods must be implemented.

Note a class can still implement a structural interface nominally. Doing so helps both people and tooling 
comprehend your code faster. The general idea is to use an interface structurally when you otherwise can't 
use it nominally or doing so overcomplicates your code.


## Type Assignability and Variance

A type is assignable to a structural interface if it provides compatible versions of all the
methods declared in the interface. The use of the term _compatible_ here instead of _identical_ is
deliberate. The looser term concerns the notion that a structural interface method is variant with respect
to the types in its signature:

```java
@Structural
public interface Capitalizer {
  CharSequence capitalize(String s);
}

public static class MyCapitalizer {
  public String capitalize(CharSequence s) {
    return s.isNullOrEmpty() ? "" : Character.toUpperCase(s.charAt(0)) + s.substring(1);
  }
}
```

At first glance it looks like `MyCapitalizer` does not satisfy the structure of `Capitalizer`, neither the
parameter type nor the return type of the method match the interface. After careful inspection, however,
it is clear the methods are call-compatible from the perspective of `Capitalizer`:

```java
Capitalizer cap = (Capitalizer) new MyCapitalizer();
CharSequence properName = cap.capitalize("tigers");
```

`MyCapitalizer`'s method can be called with `Capitalizer`'s `String` parameter because `MyCapitalizer`'s
`CharSequence` parameter is assignable from `String` -- _contravariant_ parameter types support
call-compatibility. Similarly we can accept `MyCapitalizer`'s `String` return type because it is
assignable to `Capitalizer`'s `CharSequence` return type -- _covariant_ return types support
call-compatibility. Therefore, even though their method signatures aren't identical, `MyCapitalizer` is
structurally assignable to `Capitalizer` because it is safe to use in terms of `Capitalizer`'s methods.

Signature variance also supports primitive types.  You may have spotted this in the `Component`
class referenced earlier in the `Coordinate` example where `Component.getX()` returns `int`, not `double`
as declared in `Coordinate.getX()`. Because `int` coerces to `double` with no loss of precision
the method is call-compatible. As a result signature variance holds for primitive types as well as
reference types.

## Implementation by Field

Another example where classes have wiggle room implementing structural interfaces involves property 
getter and setter methods, a.k.a. accessors and mutators. Essentially, a property represents a value you 
can access and/or change. Since a field is basically the same thing a class can implement a getter and/or 
a setter with a field:

```java
@Structural
public interface Name {
  String getName();
  void setName(String name);
}

public class Person {
  public String name;
}

Name person = (Name) new Person();
person.setName("Bubba");
String name = person.getName();
```                                                             

Basically a field implements a property method if its name matches the method's name minus the 
is/get/set prefixes and taking into account field naming conventions. For example, fields `Name`, `name`, 
and `_name` all match the `getName()` property method and are weighted in that order.


## Implementation by Extension

It's possible to implement methods of a structural interface via extension methods.  Looking back at the
`Coordinate` example, consider this class:
```java
public class Vector {
  private double _magnitude;
  private double _direction;
  
  public Vector(double magnitude, double direction) {
    _magnitude = magnitude;
    _direction = direction;
  }
  
  // Does not have X, Y coordinate methods  :(
}
```

In physics a vector and a coordinate are different ways of expressing the same thing; they can be converted 
from one to another.  So it follows the `coordSorter` example can sort `Vector` instances in terms of X, Y 
`Coordinates`... if `Vector` supplied `getX()` and `getY()` methods, which it does not.

What if an extension class supplied the methods?
  
```java
@Extension
public class MyVectorExtension {
  public double getX(@This Vector thiz) {
    return thiz.getMagnitude() * Math.cos(thiz.getDirection()); 
  }
  public double getY(@This Vector thiz) {
    return thiz.getMagnitude() * Math.sin(thiz.getDirection()); 
  }
}
```

Voila! `Vector` now structurally implements `Coordinate` and can be used with `coordSorter`.

Generally _implementation by extension_ is a powerful technique to provide a common API for classes your 
project does not control.

Nevertheless if you'd rather not add extension methods to `Vector`, or the extension class strategy is unsuitable for
your use-case e.g., the `Comparable<T>` interface sometimes makes this impossible, you can instead go a more direct
route and implement your own proxy factory...

## Implementation by Proxy

You can provide your own proxies the compiler can use to delegate structural calls.  This is especially useful to avoid
the one-time runtime overhead of the first call through a structural interface. Consider the `Coordinate` structural
interface earlier.
```java
Coordinate coord = (Coordinate) new Point(4,5);
coord.getX();
```
The first time `Point` is called through a `Coordinate` Manifold dynamically generates and compiles a proxy for `Point`
as a `Coordinate`.  Most of the time this does not matter -- avoid premature optimization! -- but when it does matter the
delay can be a problem.  To address that you can provide your own proxy ahead of time via the `IProxyFactory` service.
```java
public class Point_To_Coordinate implements IProxyFactory<Point, Coordinate> {
  @Override
  public Coordinate proxy(Point pt, Class<Coordinate> cls) {
    return new Proxy(pt);
  }

  public static class Proxy implements Coordinate
  {
    private final Point _delegate;

    public Proxy(Point pt) {
      _delegate = tp;
    }

    public double getX() {
      return _delegate.getX();
    }

    public double getY() {
      return _delegate.getY();
    }
  }
}
```
The compiler uses this proxy factory to make `Point` calls through `Coordinate`, which vastly improves the first time
call performance since it saves Manifold from dynamically generating and compiling a similar class.

Your proxy factory must be registered as a service in `META-INF` directly like so:
```
src
-- main
---- resources
------ META-INF
-------- services
---------- manifold.ext.api.IProxyFactory
```
Following standard Java [ServiceLoader protocol](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html)
you create a text file called `manifold.ext.api.IProxyFactory` in the `service` directory under your `META-INF` directory.
The file should contain the fully qualified name of your proxy factory class (the one that implements `IProxyFactory`) followed
by a new blank line:
```
com.abc.Point_To_Coordinate

```

### Using `factoryClass`
If you are the declarer of the structural interface, you can skip the Java service and specify a proxy factory
directly in the `@Structural` call site:

```java
@Structural(factoryClass = Point_To_Coordinate.class)
public interface Coordinate {
  ...
}
```

Manifold inspects the `facotryClass` to see whether or not it is appropriate for a given proxy.  For instance, from
the super class declaration `IProxyFactory<Point, Coordinate>` Manifold determines `Point_To_Coordinate` is exclusively
a proxy factory for `Point`, other classes go through the default dynamic proxy generation/compilation.  
 
 
## Dynamic Typing with `ICallHandler`

Manifold supports a form of dynamic typing via `manifold.ext.api.ICallHandler`:  

```java
public interface ICallHandler {
  /**
   * A value resulting from #call() indicating the call could not be dispatched.
   */
  Object UNHANDLED = new Object() {
    @Override
    public String toString() {
      return "Unhandled";
    }
  };

  /**
   * Dispatch a call to an interface method.
   *
   * @param iface The extended interface and owner of the method
   * @param name The name of the method
   * @param returnType The return type of the method
   * @param paramTypes The parameter types of the method
   * @param args The arguments from the call site
   * @return The result of the method call or UNHANDLED if the method is not dispatched.  
   *   Null if the method's return type is void.
   */
  Object call(Class iface, String name, Class returnType, Class[] paramTypes, Object[] args);
}
```

A class can implement `ICallHandler` nominally or it can be made to implement it via extension class.
Either way instances of the class can be cast to _any_ structural interface where structural calls
dispatch to `ICallHandler.call()`.  The class' implementation of `call()` can delegate the call any 
way it chooses.

For instance, via class extension Manifold provides `ICallHandler` support for `java.util.Map` so that 
getter and setter calls work directly with values in the map:

```java
Map<String,Object> map = new HashMap<>();
Name person = (Name) map;
person.setName("Manifold");
println(person.getName());
```
 
Because `Map` is a `ICallHandler` instances of it can be cast to any structural interface, such as
`Name` from the earlier example.  The `ICallHandler` implementation transforms get/set property calls
to get/put calls into the map using the name of the property in the method.  Additionally, method calls
can be made on map entries where the entry key matches the name of the method and the value is an instance
of a functional interface matching the signature of the call:

```java
map.put( "run", (Runnable)()-> println("hello") );
Runnable runner = (Runnable) map;
runner.run();
```

This example prints "hello" because `Map.call()` dispatches the call to the "run" entry having a 
`Runnable` functional interface value.

Note the similarity of this functionality on `Map` with _expando_ types in dynamic languages.  The
main difference is that invocations must be made through structural interfaces and not directly on 
the map, otherwise `Map` behaves much like an expando object.

See `manifold.collections.extensions.java.util.Map.MapStructExt.java` for details.

# Type-safe Reflection via `@Jailbreak`

Sometimes you have to use Java reflection to access fields, methods, and types that are not directly accessible from
your code. But writing reflection code is not only tedious and error-prone, it also loses type-safety in the process. 
Manifold mitigates these issues with the `@Jailbreak` annotation and the `jailbreak()` extension method.  Use them to
leverage the convenience and type-safety of the Java compiler and let Manifold generate reliable, efficient reflection 
code for you.

## Using `@Jailbreak`

Annotate the type of any variable with `@Jailbreak` to gain direct, type-safe access to private fields, methods, and
types.

>Note, `@Jailbreak` is ideal for use within tests. It saves you from losing type-safety that is otherwise the case with
reflection code and it enables you to maintain private methods and fields.

### Basic Use

```java
@Jailbreak Foo foo = new Foo(1);
foo.privateMethod();
foo.privateMethod("hey");
foo._privateField = 88;
```
```java
public class Foo {
  private final int _privateField;
  
  public Foo(int value) {
    _privateField = value;
  }
  
  private String privateMethod() {
    return "hi";
  }
  
  private String privateMethod(String param) {
    return param;
  }
}
```

### Use With Static Members

Since Java does not permit you to annotate the type in a static expression, you must use an instance:

```java
@Jailbreak MyClass myClass = null; // value is insignificant
myClass.staticMethod();
myClass.Static_Field = "hi";
```
```java
public class MyClass {
  private static String Static_Field = "hello";
  
  private static void staticMethod() {
  }
}
```

### Use With Types and Constructors

Use `@Jailbreak` to access hidden types and constructors:
```java
com.abc. @Jailbreak SecretClass secretClass = 
  new com.abc. @Jailbreak SecretClass("hi");
secretClass._data = "hey";
```
```java
package com.abc;
// not public
class SecretClass {
  private final String _data;

  // not public
  SecretClass(String data){
    _data = data;
  }
}
```

### Break JPMS Barriers

Access fields, methods, and constructors from packages otherwise prohibited for use in your module by the JPMS:
```java
jdk.internal.misc. @Jailbreak VM vm = null;
String[] args = vm.getRuntimeArguments();
```
        
## Using the `jailbreak()` Extension

Similar to `@Jailbreak` you can call the `jailbreak()` extension method from any expression to gain type-safe access to 
private fields, methods, and types.

```java
Foo foo = new Foo();
foo.jailbreak().privateMethodOnFoo();
```
This method is especially handy when you have a chain of member access expressions and you want to quickly use
inaccessible members:

```java
something.foo().jailbreak().bar.jailbreak().baz = value;
``` 

# The *Self* Type via `@Self`

The *Self* type is a common term used in the language community to mean *"the subtype of `this`"* and is most useful
in situations where you want a return type or parameter type of a method in a base type to reflect the subtype
i.e., the *invoking* type.  For instance, consider the `equals()` method. We all know it suffers from Java's lack of a
Self type:
```java
public class MyClass {
  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object obj) { // why Object?!
    ...
  }
}

MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
myClass.equals("nope"); // this compiles! :(
```
What we want is to somehow override `equals()` to enforce `MyClass` symmetry:
```java
public boolean equals(MyClass obj) {
  ...
}
```
But Java does not support covariance in parameter types, and for good reason. It would break if we called it like this:
```java
((Object)myClass).equals("notMyClass"); // BOOM! String is not assignable to MyClass
```

Manifold's **`@Self`** type provides an elegant solution:
```java
public boolean equals(@Self Object obj) {
  ...
}
```
Now we have the behavior we want:
```java
MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
myClass.equals("notMyClass"); // Compile Error. YES!!!
```

> Note although Java does not provide a Self type, it does provide some of its capabilities with *recursive generic types*.
But this feature can be difficult to understand and use, and the syntax it imposes is often unsuitable for class
hierarchies and APIs. Additionally, it is ineffective for cases like `equals()` -- it requires that we change the base
class definition! E.g., `public class Object<T extends Object<T>>`... oy!

But as you'll see Manifold's `@Self` annotation altogether removes the need for recursive generics. It provides Java with
a simpler, more versatile alternative.  Use it on method return types, parameter types, and field types to enforce
*"the subtype of `this`"* where suitable.

## Builders

A common use-case for the Self type involves fluent APIs like the *Builder* pattern:

```java
public class VehicleBuilder {
  private int _wheels;
  
  public VehicleBuilder withWheels(int wheels) {
    _wheels = wheels;
    return this; // returns THIS
  }
}
```  

This is fine until we subclass it:

```java
public class AirplaneBuilder extends VehicleBuilder {
  private int _wings;
  
  public AirplaneBuilder withWings(int wings) {
    _wings = wings;
    return this; // returns THIS
  }
}

...

Airplane airplane = new AirplaneBuilder()
  .withWheels(3) // returns VehicleBuilder :(
  .withWings(1)  // ERROR
```

`withWheels()` returns `VehicleBuilder`, not `AirplaneBuilder`.  This is a classic example where we want to return the 
*"the subtype of `this`"*.  This is what the self type accomplishes:

```java
  public @Self VehicleBuilder withWheels(int wheels) {
    _wheels = wheels;
    return this; // returns THIS
  }
```

Now with the return type annotated with `@Self` the example works as desired:

```java
Airplane airplane = new AirplaneBuilder()
  .withWheels(2) // returns AirplaneBuilder :)
  .withWings(1)  // GOOD!
``` 

Annotate with `@Self` to preserve the *"the subtype of `this`"* anywhere on or in a method return type, parameter type,
or field type.

## Self + Generics

You can also use `@Self` to annotate a _type argument_.  A nice example of this involves a typical graph or tree
structure where the nodes in the structure are homogeneous:

```java
public class Node {
  private List<Node> children;
  
  public List<@Self Node> getChildren() {
    return children;
  }

  public void addChild(@Self Node child) {
    children.add(child);
  }
}

public class MyNode extends Node {
  ...
}
```

Here you can make the component type of `List` the Self type so you can use the `getChildren` method type-safely from
subtypes of node:

```java
MyNode myNode = findMyNode();
List<MyNode> = myNode.getChildren(); // wunderbar! 
```

## Self + Extensions

You can use `@Self` with [extension methods](#extension-classes-via-extension) too.  Here we make an extension method as
a means to conveniently chain additions to `Map` while preserving its concrete type:

```java
public static <K,V> @Self Map<K,V> add(@This Map<K,V> thiz, K key, V value) {
  thiz.put(key, value);
  return thiz;
}

HashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<>()
  .add("nick", "grouper")
  .add("miles", "amberjack");
  .add("alec", "barracuda")
```

## Overriding Methods

Using @Self in a method return type or parameter type has _no_ effect on the method's override characteristics or binary
signature:
```java
public class SinglyNode {
  private @Self SinglyNode next;
  
  public void setNext(@Self SinglyNode next) {
    this.next = next;
  }
}

public class DoublyNode extends SinglyNode {
  private @Self DoublyNode prev;

  public void setNext(@Self SinglyNode next) {
    if(next instanceof DoublyNode) {
      super.setNext(next);
      next.prev = this;
    }
    else {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    }
  }
}
```
Of particular interest is the `@Self SinglyNode` parameter in the `DoublyNode` override. As mentioned earlier Java does not
permit covariant parameter overrides -- we can't override the method using a `DoublyNode` parameter type.  To make up for
this `@Self` informs the compiler that the parameter is indeed a `DoublyNode` when invoked from a `DoublyNode`:
```java
doublyNode.setNext(singlyNode); // Compile Error :)
doublyNode.setNext(doublyNode); // OK :)
```
This is precisely the arrangement we want.  Type-safety is enforced at the call site.  But, equally important, the
subclass handles the parameter as a base class.  Why?  Because this:
```java
((SinglyNode)doublyNode).setNext(singlyNode);
```
Here `setNext()`, although invoked as a `SinglyNode`, dispatches to the `DoublyNode` override.  Thus the `SinglyNode` parameter
type enforces that a `SinglyNode` cannot be mistaken for `DoublyNode`, hence the necessity of the `instanceof` check in
`setNext()`.
